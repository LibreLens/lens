# LibreLens (an OpenLens fork)

This repository is a direct fork of the famous [OpenLens](https://github.com/lensapp/lens) project that includes binary builds for every stable or release version.

### Why is a fork necessary?

As of today, Mirantis, the main developers behind Lens only release a [propritary version of Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) on their Website. While LibreLens can not provide any nameful support, it still offers many advantages compared to the Mirantis business solution:

- The propritary version [requires LensID](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/issues/5444) and your agreement to their Terms of Service. This open source build is MIT licensed and allows you to do with it whatever you want.
- The propritary version adds additional features that you may want to have, especially if collaborating with a team. This open source build does only include the features that are not also included in this repository.
- The proprietary version follows a subscription model that allows Mirantis to support your exact needs. This open source build provides you with a tool and that's it. No business support, no cost, no terms of service.
